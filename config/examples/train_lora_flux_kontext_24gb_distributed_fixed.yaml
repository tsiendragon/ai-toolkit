      # 重要：确保您的训练数据数量至少等于或大于 GPU 数量
      # 例如：如果使用 4 个 GPU，至少需要 4 张训练图片
      # 否则会出现 'NoneType' object is not iterable 错误

      # if a trigger word is specified, it will be added to captions of training data if it does not already exist
      # alternatively, in your captions you can add [trigger] and it will be replaced with the trigger word
